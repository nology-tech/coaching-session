# Coaching Assessment - October 2020

## Coaching Notes

This task is designed for the coach to be writing the code as in a codealong in a lesson, while teaching very small concepts one after another. After each concept, the coach will ask the student to contribute, either by checking understanding or by asking them to Google something and contribute the next line of code.

After the coaching is complete, the student will complete a small assessment and the coach will complete a feedback document. Find the links below
