            <p>
                Bruce is a living legend. It has been agreed by at least two
                people that he is the best live performer of all time.

            <p>
                Stevie Nicks is awesome. She is the lead singer of the best
                band ever, Fleetwood Mac.

            <h2>Meat Loaf</h2>
            <p>
                Meat Loaf is quite frightening. He isn't particularly good 
                live but had a great part in the film Fight Club (1999).
